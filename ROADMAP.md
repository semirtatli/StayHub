## How to Resume After Context Reset

1. Read this `ROADMAP.md` to understand the full plan and current progress
2. Run `git log --oneline` to confirm which commits are done
3. Read `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` for architecture details
4. Read `docs/database/domain-model.md` for entity/aggregate details
5. Check `Directory.Packages.props` for current NuGet package versions
6. Continue from the next ⬚ item in the roadmap above
7. After each commit, update this file: change ⬚ to ✅ and add the commit message
8. Keep commit messages short: `feat: add shared kernel library`

## Conventions

- **Commit style**: `feat:`, `docs:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` prefixes
- **Branch**: all work on `main` (single developer)
- **Push after every commit**
- **Explain each commit to user**: what was done, why, interview talking points
- **Wait for user confirmation** before proceeding to next commit
